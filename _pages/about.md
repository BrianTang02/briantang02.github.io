My name is Yuanchen Tang(唐元宸). I'm a senior(fourth-year undergraduate) student at Turing Class, [Peking University](www.pku.edu.cn).
I have been working as a research intern at PKU CFCS, advised by Prof. Xiaotie Deng. During this summer, I had a wonderful time at CMU working with Prof. [Steven Wu](zstevenwu.com).
This is my personal page in progress.
