## More About Me
I love various kinds of sports, especially table tennis and basketball, and I'm a fan of Stephen Curry. Music also plays a significant role in my life. I learned piano and singing in my childhood, developing a strong relative pitch. and always be fascinated by voices navigating accurately between different pitches. Additionally, I enjoy exploring the principles of human behavior in social settings, which enriches my observations and insights for both scientific research and personal lifestyle.
